# CODEOWNERS File Template
#
# This file specifies individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.
# When someone opens a pull request that modifies code owned by a CODEOWNERS entry,
# the designated code owners are automatically requested for a review.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more @username or @organization/team-name.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/about-codeowners

# Default owners for all files. Optional, but good practice.
# * @your-org/default-dev-team

# Protect the /infra directory (e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes configs, CloudFormation)
# requiring review from the infrastructure team.
/infra/ @your-org/infra-team @your-username-infra

# Protect the /auth directory (e.g., authentication services, identity management)
# requiring review from the security or dedicated auth team.
/auth/ @your-org/security-team @your-org/auth-team

# Example for specific file types or subdirectories
# /src/services/billing/ @your-org/billing-team
# *.js @your-org/frontend-team
# *.py @your-org/backend-team

# Ensure that the root README.md is reviewed by a designated lead or documentation team.
# /README.md @your-org/documentation-lead

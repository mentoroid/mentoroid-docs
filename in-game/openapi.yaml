    ## Overview
    | Service | Port | Purpose |
    |---------|------|---------|
    | Coaching Backend | 39144 | Pipeline control, player setup |
    | GSI Handler | 19151 | Dota 2 Game State Integration |
    | Match Events | 18100 | Flutter implements this server |

    ## What's New in v2.1.0

    ### Voice Pack System
    New voice control endpoints for selecting and previewing TTS voice packs:
    - `POST /voice_set` - Set voice pack (fin = male, lily = female)
    - `GET /voice_get` - Get current voice and available options
    - `GET /voice_list` - List all voice packs with metadata
    - `POST /voice_sample` - Preview voice without changing setting

    ## What's New in v2.0.0

    ### Automated Features
    The following features are now **fully automated** and no longer require manual API calls:
    - **Pipeline Start/Stop**: Auto-detection watcher starts pipeline when Dota 2 opens, stops when it closes
    - **Match Detection**: Automatically detects match start and end via GSI
    - **Hero Detection**: Automatically identifies the player's hero via GSI
    - **Role Detection**: Player selects role via in-game keyboard shortcut (1-5)

    ### Deprecated Workflow
    Previously required manual calls to `/start` and `/stop` - these are now optional and handled automatically.

    ## Flutter Integration Flow
    1. `GET /ready` - Check backend is running
    2. `GET /player_info` - Check if Steam ID is configured
    3. `POST /set_player` - Set Steam ID (one-time setup)
    4. **Done** - Auto-detection handles everything else

    Backend will automatically POST to Flutter's `/match_started` and `/match_end` endpoints.

    ## Auto-Detection Watcher
    The watcher monitors for the Dota 2 process:
    - **Dota 2 Opens** -> Pipeline auto-starts, GSI begins receiving data
    - **Dota 2 Closes** -> Pipeline auto-stops, resources cleaned up
    - No polling required from Flutter side

    ## Flutter Server Requirements (Port 18100)
    Flutter must implement a local HTTP server on port 18100 with two POST endpoints.
    The coaching backend will call these endpoints automatically during gameplay.

    ## GSI Setup (Windows)

    ### Step 1: Create config folder
    Navigate to your Dota 2 cfg folder and create the GSI folder:
    ```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\gamestate_integration\
    ```

    ### Step 2: Create config file
    Inside gamestate_integration folder, create `gamestate_integration_mentoroid.cfg`:
    ```
    "Dota 2 Integration Configuration"
    {
        "uri"          "http://localhost:19151/"
        "timeout"      "5.0"
        "buffer"       "0.1"
        "throttle"     "0.1"
        "heartbeat"    "10.0"
        "data"
        {
            "auth"            "mentoroid_gsi"
            "provider"        "1"
            "map"             "1"
            "player"          "1"
            "hero"            "1"
            "abilities"       "1"
            "items"           "1"
            "events"          "1"
            "buildings"       "1"
            "league"          "1"
            "draft"           "1"
            "wearables"       "1"
            "minimap"         "1"
            "roshan"          "1"
            "couriers"        "1"
            "neutralitems"    "1"
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Step 3: Enable in Dota 2
    In Dota 2: Settings -> Social -> Enable "Share match data with third-party sources"

        Configure the Steam ID for the player. This is a **one-time setup** required before coaching can begin.
        The backend uses this to identify the player in GSI data and fetch player statistics.

        **To replace an existing Steam ID:**
        - Pass `force: true` in the request body
        - Without force, returns error if Steam ID already set
